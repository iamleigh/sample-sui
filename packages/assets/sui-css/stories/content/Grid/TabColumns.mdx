<Section title="Usage" contained={true} border={true} style={{ paddingTop: 0 }}>
	Column classes organize the columns out of the amount you need per row
	based on the twelve-column grid size; this means if you need to display
	three equal-width columns, you must divide the size of the grid by the
	number of columns, which in this case, is twelve. The result you get is
	the column size.

	By default, the columns align equally in size to occupy the entire row
	width in case alignment is inline, but if that is not the case, then the
	columns will properly align one below each other in stacked mode.

	Enable column styles; for that, use the class name as in the sample code
	below:

	<Snippet language="html">{codeCol}</Snippet>

	Remember, columns must go inside a row to work correctly.
</Section>

<Section title="Modifiers" contained={true}>
	When columns are inline aligned, you can use the modifier class to
	specify the column size in a twelve-grid row instead of leaving it for
	auto-sizing. These modifiers won't affect when the row aligns columns in
	stacked mode.

	Enable column sizing; for that, use the class name as in the sample code
	below, being <Code>$size</Code> a number between 1 to 12:

	<Snippet language="html">{codesize}</Snippet>

	Remember, the column's size sum must be at most 12, the limit of columns
	allowed per row.
